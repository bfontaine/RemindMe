# RemindMe

*Note: This project is not supported anymore. I made it for someone who now has
a smartphone and can setup reminders instead of scheduling SMS messages. Feel
free to reuse or adapt the code to your needs.*

## Setup

    make bootstrap

You need to install LESS:

    [sudo] npm -g install less

## Run

You have to run three different jobs:

```sh
# run the DB
make startdb

# run the app
make run

# run the scheduler
make scheduler
```

## i18n

### Adding a locale

As an example, let’s say we want to add the spanish locale: `es`. We need to
initialize the l10n files:

```sh
venv/bin/pybabel init -i messages.pot -d translations -l es
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angular/angular.js/master/src/ngLocale/angular-locale_es.js" > static/js/angular-locale_es.js
make babel-extract
```

Now edit `translations/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`, then compile it:

```sh
make babel-compile
```

That’s it.
